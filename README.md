 ##### time series analysis 
 
 ##### EDA
 ##### baseline - exponential smoothing model (ESM)
 ##### Dickey-Fuller test - check stationary and correct it
 ##### KPSS test 
 ##### ACF and PACF
 ###### AR model and MA model
 ##### ARIMA (Autoregressive and moving average combined) (p,d,q)
 ##### model evaluation
 
 ###### p is the order of the autoregressive part 
 ###### d is the order of the differencing 
 ###### q is the order of the moving-average process 

 ##### Box-Pierce test - check auto-correlation of residuals
 ##### Seasonality and Trends
 
 ##### retrieve financial statements
 ##### retrieve stock values - quandl
 ##### modeling with prophet package
 ##### market cap prediction
 ##### identify trends - is it a random walk in short term?
 
 ##### apply neural networks - RNN - recurrent neural networks
 ##### RNN with LTSM


### upload the code, REMEMBER
